# Modal Display Fix - Penalty Preview Modal

## Issue
The penalty preview modal was being hidden behind the sidebar and not displaying properly due to z-index conflicts.

## Root Cause
- Modal had `z-index: 999` which was lower than the sidebar's z-index
- Modal was using `display: block` instead of `display: flex` for centering
- No body scroll prevention when modal was open
- Missing responsive design for mobile devices

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Increased Z-Index**
```css
.approval-modal {
    z-index: 10000; /* Changed from 999 to 10000 */
}
```
**Result:** Modal now appears above all other elements including sidebar

### 2. **Enhanced Modal Backdrop**
```css
.approval-modal {
    background: rgba(0,0,0,0.6); /* Darkened from 0.4 to 0.6 */
    backdrop-filter: blur(2px);  /* Added blur effect */
}
```
**Result:** Better visual separation and focus on modal content

### 3. **Improved Modal Sizing**
```css
.penalty-preview-modal {
    max-width: 700px;
    width: 95%;
    max-height: 90vh;
    overflow-y: auto;
    animation: modalSlideIn 0.3s ease-out;
}
```
**Result:** Responsive sizing that works on all screen sizes

### 4. **Sticky Header**
```css
.penalty-preview-header {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    z-index: 10;
}
```
**Result:** Close button always visible even when scrolling modal content

### 5. **JavaScript Improvements**
```javascript
// Show modal
penaltyPreviewModal.style.display = 'flex'; // Changed from 'block'
document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';     // Prevent background scroll

// Close modal
penaltyPreviewModal.style.display = 'none';
document.body.style.overflow = '';           // Restore scroll
```
**Result:** Proper centering and scroll management

### 6. **Mobile Responsive Design**
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .penalty-preview-modal {
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 100%;
        max-height: 100vh;
        border-radius: 0;
    }
    
    .penalty-preview-actions {
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
    }
    
    .penalty-preview-actions button {
        width: 100%;
    }
}
```
**Result:** Full-screen modal on mobile with stacked buttons

### 7. **Smooth Animations**
```css
@keyframes modalSlideIn {
    from {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(-30px) scale(0.95);
    }
    to {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0) scale(1);
    }
}
```
**Result:** Professional slide-in animation when modal opens
