# Phase 4: Damage Penalty Management System

**Implementation Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Manual Damage Penalty Workflow Implemented

---

## Overview

Phase 4 implements a manual damage penalty workflow that lets administrators document penalties for equipment returned with detected damage. The system integrates with the existing image comparison flow to flag damaged returns, pre-fill the penalty form, and capture admin judgment without any financial processing or automated fee computation.

---

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Simplified Penalties Database Schema**
- **File:** `database/migrations/20251027_enhance_penalties_for_damage.sql`
- **Columns Added/Updated:**
  - `equipment_id`, `equipment_name` – reference the item tied to the penalty.
  - `damage_severity` – enum (`minor`, `moderate`, `severe`, `total_loss`).
  - `damage_notes` – free-form notes for admin judgment.
  - `description` column relaxed to allow NULL (admin can rely on damage notes).
- **New Table:**
  - `penalty_damage_assessments` – stores detected issues, similarity score, comparison summary, and admin assessment.
- **View:**
  - `v_pending_damage_penalties` – lists pending damage penalties with their captured assessments.

### 2. **Return Verification Modal Updates**
- **File:** `admin/admin-all-transaction.php`
- **Changes:**
  - Replaced "Reject Return" button with "Add to Penalty" button
  - New purple-themed button with gavel icon
  - Automatically captures:
    - Transaction ID
    - Equipment name
    - Detected issues from image comparison
    - Similarity score
    - Severity level
  - Redirects to penalty management with pre-populated data

### 3. **Damage Penalty Workflow**
- **Flow:**
  1. Admin reviews returned equipment in transaction modal.
  2. If damage detected, clicks “Add to Penalty”.
  3. System redirects to `admin-penalty-management.php` with comparison data.
  4. Penalty form auto-populates with transaction details and detected issues.
  5. Admin selects a severity level, adds assessment notes, and records the penalty (manual judgment only – no automatic fee calculation).

### 4. **Enhanced Penalty Management Page**
- **File:** `admin/admin-penalty-management.php`
- **New Features:**
  - **Damage Penalty Mode:** Special form appears when coming from transaction review
  - **Auto-populated Fields:**
    - Transaction ID, Student ID, Equipment details.
    - Detected issues from image comparison.
    - Similarity score with color coding (red < 50%, yellow < 70%, green ≥ 70%).
  - **Damage Severity Selection:** dropdown provides severity levels but does not enforce monetary amounts.
  - **Admin Damage Assessment:** textarea for describing observed damage.
  - **Final Decision Notes:** textarea for documenting the action/penalty to apply.
  - **Visual Design:** 
    - Highlighted section with gradient background
    - Color-coded similarity scores
    - Detected issues displayed in warning box
    - Grid layout for transaction details

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE `penalties`
  ADD COLUMN `equipment_id` VARCHAR(50) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN `equipment_name` VARCHAR(255) NULL,
  ADD COLUMN `damage_severity` ENUM('minor','moderate','severe','total_loss') NULL,
  ADD COLUMN `damage_notes` TEXT NULL,
  MODIFY COLUMN `penalty_type` ENUM('Overdue','Damaged','Lost','Misuse','Other') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Other',
  MODIFY COLUMN `status` ENUM('Pending','Under Review','Resolved','Cancelled') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pending',
  MODIFY COLUMN `description` TEXT NULL;

CREATE TABLE `penalty_damage_assessments` (
  `id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `penalty_id` INT NOT NULL,
  `detected_issues` TEXT NULL,
  `similarity_score` DECIMAL(5,2) NULL,
  `comparison_summary` VARCHAR(500) NULL,
  `admin_assessment` TEXT NULL,
  `created_at` TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (`penalty_id`) REFERENCES `penalties`(`id`) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `v_pending_damage_penalties` AS
SELECT p.id, p.transaction_id, p.user_id, p.equipment_id, p.equipment_name,
       p.damage_severity, p.damage_notes, p.status, p.created_at,
       da.detected_issues, da.similarity_score
FROM penalties p
LEFT JOIN penalty_damage_assessments da ON da.penalty_id = p.id
WHERE p.penalty_type = 'Damaged' AND p.status IN ('Pending','Under Review')
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### JavaScript Integration

**Return Verification Modal (admin-all-transaction.php):**
```javascript
// Handle add_penalty action - redirect to penalty management
if (action === 'add_penalty') {
    const params = new URLSearchParams({
        action: 'create_damage_penalty',
        transaction_id: transactionId,
        equipment_name: equipmentName,
        detected_issues: detectedIssues,
        similarity_score: similarityScore,
        severity_level: severityLevel
    });
    
    window.location.href = `admin-penalty-management.php?${params.toString()}`;
    return;
}
```

**Penalty Management (admin-penalty-management.php):**
```javascript
//// (No auto-calculation—severity only informs manual judgment.)
```

### PHP Backend Logic

**Damage Penalty Mode Detection:**
```php
// Check if coming from damage penalty workflow
$damage_penalty_mode = false;
$damage_penalty_data = [];
if (isset($_GET['action']) && $_GET['action'] === 'create_damage_penalty') {
    $damage_penalty_mode = true;
    
    // Fetch transaction details
    $txn_query = $conn->prepare("SELECT t.*, u.student_id, u.name as user_name, 
        e.name as equipment_full_name, e.rfid_tag 
        FROM transactions t 
        LEFT JOIN users u ON t.user_id = u.id 
        LEFT JOIN equipment e ON t.equipment_id = e.rfid_tag 
        WHERE t.id = ?");
    // ... execute and populate $damage_penalty_data
}
```

## Severity Guidelines

| Severity | Amount | Points | Description | Auto-Selected When |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Minor** | ₱50.00 | 5 | Cosmetic damage only, no functional impact | Similarity ≥ 70% |
| **Moderate** | ₱200.00 | 15 | Affects appearance or partial functionality | 50% ≤ Similarity < 70% |
| **Severe** | ₱500.00 | 30 | Significant functionality loss, major repairs needed | Similarity < 50% |
| **Total Loss** | ₱1,000.00 | 50 | Equipment beyond repair or completely non-functional | Manual selection only |

---

## Integration with Image Comparison System

The damage penalty system seamlessly integrates with the existing offline image comparison system:

1. **Image Comparison Results:**
   - Similarity score (0-100%)
   - Detected issues list (e.g., "Item mismatch detected", "Object structure not recognized")
   - Severity level (none, medium, high)

2. **Automatic Routing:**
   - When admin clicks "Add to Penalty" in return verification modal
   - All comparison data is passed to penalty management
   - Severity is pre-selected based on similarity score

3. **Data Flow:**
   ```
   Return Photo → Image Comparison → Detected Issues → 
   Admin Review → Add to Penalty → Penalty Management → 
   Severity Selection → Amount Calculation → Penalty Created
   ```
