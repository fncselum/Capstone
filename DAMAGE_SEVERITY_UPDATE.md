## Auto-Selection Logic

The system automatically selects the appropriate severity level based on similarity score:

```php
// Minor: 70-100%
if ($similarity_score >= 70) → 'minor'

// Moderate: 50-70%
if ($similarity_score >= 50 && $similarity_score < 70) → 'moderate'

// Severe: <50%
if ($similarity_score < 50) → 'severe'

// Total Loss: Manual selection only
```
